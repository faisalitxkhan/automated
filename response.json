# AI Content Humanizer Frontend

This is a single-page web application that serves as a frontend for an **n8n AI Agent**. It takes AI-generated text as input, sends it to an n8n webhook, and displays the "humanized" result.

## 🚀 Features
- **Clean UI:** Modern, responsive design using Inter font and gradients.
- **Session Tracking:** Automatically generates unique Session IDs for n8n memory.
- **Status Indicators:** Loading, success, and error states.
- **Keyboard Shortcut:** Supports `Ctrl + Enter` to submit.

1. Create a **Webhook** node in n8n.
2. Set the HTTP Method to **POST**.
3. **Important:** In the Webhook node settings, enable **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**. If you don't do this, the browser will block the request. 
   - *Allowed Origins:* `*` (or your specific domain).

### 2. Updating the Webhook URL
In the `index.html` file, locate the `fetch` function inside the `<script>` tag (around line 345):

```javascript
const response = await fetch('[https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/your-id](https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/your-id)', { ...
